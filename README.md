<!--Intro start-->

- üî≠ I am a full stack developer and have used MERN stack, next.js, and other web2 related languages in personal projects, GitHub contributions, companies, technical communities, clubs, etc.

* üíº I've worked at **[Rariko](https://twitter.com/rariko_info), [Save Right](https://www.linkedin.com/company/saveright/), [Konma](https://www.linkedin.com/company/konmacommunity/mycompany/) officially as an Web2, Android, and a Web3 developer** respectively, and unofficial with couple of startups where I have been a part of discussion.

* üë®‚Äçüíª I have freelanced couple of companies as a developer like:

1. [Pinko](https://www.instagram.com/pinkoofficial/), an Italian Fashion Brand, where I (with a team) have built a complete website where people could buy their products using Web3 tokens by connecting their wallets using Metamask, or could mint the collection of products into their account.
2. [Dotsei Domains](https://twitter.com/dotseidomains) which is a solution to make Web3 addresses easy. Here I built a complete website for various activities, which will be revealed soon by the company!! Few features will be made public soon officially, here's its link: [Dotsei](https://dotsei.me/).

- üë®‚Äçüíª Have solved **more than 400 questions** of DSA collectively on leetcode, gfg, and codingninjas. I believe in quality questions, rather than quantity, and have revised good questions multiple times.

- As the **GDSC Lead** for 2023-24, I've been organizing both offline and online tech sessions in collaboration with other universities. We bring in **industry experts** to help students explore **real-world applications** of new technologies, fostering a broader perspective.

- As an MLSA, I've been collaborating globally, hosting impactful technical sessions to teach diverse technologies and connect with interesting individuals.

- ‚ú® I've contributed to several open-source projects, some are:

1. [NFT_Marketplace](https://github.com/yessGlory17/nft-marketplace)
2. [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp): I have merged 4 of my PRs for [this website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/). The experience to contribute at FreeCodeCamp has really been good. Have been part of a detailed in depth discussion with the develper at FCC on a feature with over 69 follow-ups on a single PR, and other discussions.
3. [developer.chrome.com](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/developer.chrome.com): I have proposed a design enhancement at [developers.chrome website](https://developer.chrome.com/), which have been approved by the designer, and have been merged successfully.
